Reinforcement Learning Algorithms on FrozenLake-v1


This project demonstrates various reinforcement learning algorithms applied to the FrozenLake-v1 environment from OpenAI's Gymnasium. The implemented algorithms include Value Iteration, Policy Iteration, Q-Learning, Epsilon-Greedy Policy, and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Action Selection.


Installation
Before running the code, you need to install the necessary libraries. You can do this directly within the Jupyter notebook or Google Colab by running the following command:



1. Value Iteration
Value Iteration is a method of computing the optimal policy and value function for a Markov Decision Process (MDP).



2. Policy Iteration
Policy Iteration involves two steps: policy evaluation and policy improvement. It iteratively improves the policy until it converges to the optimal policy.



3. Q-Learning
Q-Learning is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of the optimal policy by interacting with the environment.



4. Epsilon-Greedy Policy
An epsilon-greedy policy is used in conjunction with Q-Learning to balance exploration and exploitation by choosing either a random action or the best-known action.



5. Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Action Selection
The UCB action selection algorithm is used to select actions based on upper confidence bounds, balancing exploration and exploitation.
